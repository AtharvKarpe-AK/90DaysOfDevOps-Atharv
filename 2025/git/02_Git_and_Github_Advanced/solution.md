# Solution: Week 4: Git & GitHub Advanced Challenge

## 1. Working on a New Feature and Creating a PR

### Step-by-step Commands:
```bash
# Step 1: Clone the forked repository
git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>

# Step 2: Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature-branch

# Step 3: Make changes
echo "New Feature" >> feature.txt

# Step 4: Stage and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Added a new feature"

# Step 5: Push the changes to your fork
git push origin feature-branch
```
Step 6: Open a Pull Request
Go to your forked repository on GitHub.

You'll see a prompt to "Compare & pull request" ‚Äî click it.

Ensure the base branch is master or main and the compare branch is your feature-branch.

Add a title and description, then click Create pull request.

Request a review if needed.

Once approved, click Merge pull request and then Delete branch (optional cleanup).

2. Steps to Create a Pull Request (PR)
Push your feature branch to your forked repository.

Navigate to the repository on GitHub.

Click Compare & pull request.

Add a meaningful title and detailed description.

Assign reviewers or team members.

Submit the PR.

Monitor and respond to any review feedback.

Merge the PR once approved.

3. Best Practices for Writing PR Descriptions
Title: Clear and concise, summarizing the change (e.g., Add login feature to user dashboard)

What: Explain what the PR does.

Why: Briefly state the reasoning or problem it solves.

How: Mention any specific implementation details, dependencies, or risks.

Extras: Link to related issues, screenshots (if UI), or docs.


###Task 2: Undoing Changes ‚Äì Reset & Revert

Differences Between git reset and git revert

| Feature            | `git reset`                       | `git revert`                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Action**         | Moves the branch pointer backward | Creates a new commit that undoes previous one |
| **Data Loss Risk** | Yes (especially with `--hard`)    | No                                            |
| **History**        | Rewrites history                  | Preserves history                             |
| **Usage Scope**    | Local work                        | Safe for shared/public branches               |
| **Undo Commits?**  | Yes                               | Yes                                           |
| **Undo Changes?**  | Yes (with `--mixed` or `--hard`)  | No (just reverses commit logic)               |


When to Use Each Method
‚úÖ Use git reset when:
You‚Äôre working locally and want to clean up your commit history.

You want to remove one or more commits before pushing.

You accidentally committed files and want to undo before sharing.

You‚Äôre okay with possibly losing uncommitted changes (especially with --hard).

‚úÖ Use git revert when:
You already pushed the commit to a shared/public branch.

You want to undo a commit without altering history.

You're working in a team environment and need a safe way to fix mistakes.

You want to preserve an audit trail of every action.



###Task 3: Stashing - Save Work Without Committing

When to Use `git stash`

`git stash` is used when you need to **temporarily set aside** your local changes (both staged and unstaged) so you can:

- Switch to a different branch to work on something urgent
- Pull the latest changes from a remote branch without committing partial work
- Perform tests or fixes without losing your ongoing work
- Experiment with something and return to your previous state later

It helps you keep your working directory clean **without committing incomplete or experimental changes**.

## Commands:

```bash
# Save uncommitted changes
git stash

# List all stashed changes
git stash list

# Reapply the most recent stash (and remove it from stash list)
git stash pop

# Reapply the most recent stash (but keep it in the stash list)
git stash apply

# Drop a specific stash entry
git stash drop stash@{0}

# Clear all stash entries
git stash clear

```

Difference Between git stash pop and git stash apply

| Command           | Behavior                                                                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git stash apply` | Reapplies the changes from the latest (or specified) stash but **keeps it in the list** |
| `git stash pop`   | Reapplies the changes **and removes** the stash entry from the stash list               |




###Task 4: Cherry-Picking - Selectively Apply Commits

Using Cherry-Picking for Bug Fixes
What is Cherry-Picking?
Cherry-picking in Git is the act of selecting specific commits from one branch and applying them to another. This is useful when you want to apply a fix or feature from a development or feature branch into a stable branch (like main or release) without merging the whole branch.

üìå When to Use It for Bug Fixes
Cherry-picking is often used to:

Backport a bug fix from main to an older release branch

Apply a fix from a feature branch to main before the whole feature is ready

Isolate important hotfixes without pulling in unrelated work

Example:
Suppose a bug was fixed in a feature branch with commit fab5c2b. Instead of merging the entire branch, you can cherry-pick just the fix:


‚ö†Ô∏è Risks of Cherry-Picking
While cherry-picking can be convenient, it comes with several risks:

1. Duplicate Commits / Merge Conflicts Later
Cherry-picked commits are copied with a new SHA, so Git does not recognize them as the same. When the original branch is merged later, you may get:

Merge conflicts

Duplicated changes

2. Loss of Context
Cherry-picking isolates a commit from its original context. This can:

Break dependencies between commits

Lead to confusing histories

Introduce bugs if the cherry-picked commit relies on other unseen changes

3. History Complexity
Frequent cherry-picking can clutter your Git history, making it hard to understand where fixes came from and how they relate to other work.

4. Maintenance Overhead
Teams must track what was cherry-picked where. Without proper tracking (e.g., commit messages or tags), it‚Äôs easy to lose track of what's been applied.

‚úÖ Best Practices
Always test cherry-picked commits in their new context.

Document cherry-picked commits in messages (e.g., cherry-picked from <commit-sha>).

Avoid cherry-picking large, dependent commits.

Consider alternatives like git merge -s ours or patch-based workflows if you need more control.


###


üîÄ Difference Between Merge and Rebase
Both git merge and git rebase are used to integrate changes from one branch into another, but they work differently and serve different purposes.

üîÅ Git Merge
git merge combines two branches by creating a new merge commit that ties together the histories of both branches.

Example:

git checkout main
git merge feature


‚ûï Pros:
Preserves the exact history and context of both branches

Ideal for public/shared branches

‚ûñ Cons:
Can clutter history with extra merge commits

Can be harder to trace a linear path of changes


üîÑ Git Rebase
git rebase moves or ‚Äúreplays‚Äù your branch's commits on top of another branch, rewriting the commit history to be linear.

Example:
git checkout feature
git rebase main


This makes it look like your work on feature was based on the latest main ‚Äî as if you started from there.

‚ûï Pros:
Cleaner, linear commit history

Easier to follow chronological development

Useful before merging to avoid unnecessary merge commits

‚ûñ Cons:
Rewrites history, which can cause problems if the branch is shared

Must be used with caution on public branches

‚úÖ Best Practices for Rebasing
Only Rebase Local/Private Branches

Never rebase branches that others are working on unless you coordinate carefully.

Rewriting public history can cause conflicts and confusion.

Use git pull --rebase to Stay Updated

Keeps your local branch up to date without creating unnecessary merge commits.

Example:
git pull --rebase origin main


Use Interactive Rebase for Cleanups

Use git rebase -i to edit, squash, or reorder commits before merging.

Example:
git rebase -i HEAD~5


Resolve Conflicts Carefully

During rebase, resolve conflicts at each step and use git rebase --continue to proceed.

Avoid Rebasing Long-Lived or Shared Branches

For long-lived feature branches or release branches, consider using merge instead.

Always Verify After Rebase

Run your tests and verify your project still works correctly after rebasing.



###Task 6: Branching Strategies Used in Companies

üöÄ Git Workflows in DevOps
Effective branching strategies are essential for managing code collaboration, ensuring stability, and enabling continuous delivery in DevOps environments. Below are three widely used Git workflows:

üîß 1. Git Flow
Overview:
Git Flow introduces a structured branching model ideal for applications with planned releases and long-term maintenance. It defines specific branch types for different purposes.

üîÅ Branch Types:
main (production-ready)

develop (integration branch)

feature/* (new features)

release/* (preparation for release)

hotfix/* (emergency fixes to main)

‚ûï Pros:
Clear structure and role of each branch

Ideal for large teams and scheduled releases

Separates development and production workflows

‚ûñ Cons:
Heavy process; not ideal for fast-paced DevOps

Delays integration; not CI/CD friendly

Frequent merges and potential for conflicts

‚úÖ Use when:
You have planned release cycles and need clear control over production vs development.

üîÑ 2. GitHub Flow
Overview:
A lightweight workflow optimized for Continuous Deployment. There‚Äôs only one long-lived branch: main.

üß™ Workflow:
Branch off main for a new feature

Make changes and open a pull request

Review and merge to main after testing

‚ûï Pros:
Simple, fast, and CI/CD ready

Ideal for cloud-native and SaaS teams

Promotes rapid iteration and continuous delivery

‚ûñ Cons:
Less structure; not suitable for complex release requirements

Requires robust automated testing and CI pipelines

‚úÖ Use when:
You deploy frequently and favor agility over structure.

üå≥ 3. Trunk-Based Development (TBD)
Overview:
In TBD, developers commit directly (or through short-lived branches) to a shared branch called main or trunk. The goal is rapid integration and frequent commits.

üîÑ Workflow:
Feature branches last a few hours to a day

Continuous Integration runs on each commit

Changes are integrated early and often

‚ûï Pros:
Enables high-velocity delivery

Reduces merge conflicts

Ideal for CI/CD, microservices, and DevOps teams

‚ûñ Cons:
Requires high test coverage and disciplined development

Needs strong CI tooling and fast pipelines

Risky without gated merges or feature flags

‚úÖ Use when:
You practice CI/CD and want maximum development speed with automation.


üèÜ Which Strategy is Best for DevOps and CI/CD?
üëâ Recommended: Trunk-Based Development

Why?

Encourages frequent integration and fast feedback

Works perfectly with automated testing and CI pipelines

Reduces long-lived branches and conflicts

Powers elite DevOps teams (used by Google, Facebook, etc.)

‚úÖ Best Practices
Use feature flags to safely integrate incomplete work

Keep feature branches short-lived (ideally under a day)

Automate testing and deployments using CI/CD pipelines

Regularly review and clean up stale branches
